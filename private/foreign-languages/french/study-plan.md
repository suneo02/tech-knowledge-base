# 🇫🇷 French Study Plan

## 📊 Current Situation Analysis
(Refer to [My Language Profile](../../README.md#my-language-profile) for general background)
**Core Issue**: Absolute beginner, for hobby only.
**Goal**: Enjoyment and basic travel capability.
**Strategy**: Gamified learning + Cultural immersion. Keep it fun and consistent.

## 🗺️ Roadmap: The "Hobbyist" Approach

Since this is for a hobby, we will prioritize **enjoyment** and **consistency** over intensity.

### 1) Phase 1: The "Game" Phase (Months 1-3)
*Build a habit without feeling like "studying".*

*   **Primary Tool**: **Duolingo** (Since you use it for English, add the French course).
    *   *Target*: 1-2 lessons per day (10-15 mins).
    *   *Focus*: Basic vocabulary, pronunciation, simple sentence structure.
*   **Pronunciation First**:
    *   French pronunciation is tricky. Watch a few YouTube videos on the **French Alphabet** and **Nasal Sounds**.
    *   *Channel Recommendation*: "French with Pierre" or "Comme une Française" (Look for their beginner playlists).

### 2) Phase 2: Comprehensible Input (Months 3-6)
*Start listening to real French, even if you don't understand everything.*

*   **YouTube**: **Easy French** (Street interviews with subtitles). Watch one video a week.
*   **Podcasts**: **Coffee Break French** (Great for commutes).
*   **Music/Media**: Create a French playlist on Spotify/Apple Music. Listen to get used to the rhythm of the language.

### 3) Routine (Low Stress)
*   **Daily**: 15 mins Duolingo (Commute/Breakfast).
*   **Weekly**: 1 Cultural Activity (Watch a French movie with subtitles, listen to French music, cook a French recipe).

### 💡 Tips for Chinese Speakers
*   **Grammar**: French grammar has gender (masculine/feminine) like many European languages, which is very different from Chinese/English. Don't stress about memorizing rules initially; just get used to the patterns.
*   **Pronunciation**: The "R" sound is guttural (back of the throat). It takes practice. Don't be shy!
