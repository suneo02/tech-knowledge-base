## 📝 Learning Philosophy

### Key Principles
1.  **Consistency**: Small daily habits (15 mins) > Occasional marathons.
2.  **Input + Output**: Balance consuming content (Podcasts/Reading) with creating it (Speaking/Writing).
3.  **Immersion**: Change device languages, consume tech news in target language.

### Recommended Tools
*   **Anki**: For vocabulary spaced repetition.
*   **Duolingo**: For maintaining streaks and basic grammar.
*   **YouTube/Podcasts**: For comprehensible input (Tech talks, Vlogs).
