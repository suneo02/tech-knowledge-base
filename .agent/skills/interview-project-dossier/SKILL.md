# Interview Project Dossier

## Purpose

Convert a project into interview-prep assets: a full dossier (whitepaper) and, when requested, an oral script. Keep outputs evidence-backed, text-only, and interview-ready.

## Modes

- Dossier mode (whitepaper): full-coverage project dossier with evidence anchors.
- Script mode: oral hook + STAR-Plus deep dive + defensive Q&A.

## Quick Start

- Choose mode.
- Always apply baseline rules: read `references/baseline.md`.
- Dossier mode: read `references/dossier-guide.md` and `references/dossier-template.md`.
- Script mode: read `references/script.md`.
- If the user only needs resume bullets, route to `interview-project-resume`.

## Core Constraints

- Output language: Chinese.
- Text-only Markdown; no code blocks, diagrams, or tables.
- First-person narrative (我...).
- Evidence anchors required for key claims.

## Workflow (High Level)

1. Decide mode and scope.
2. Gather inputs per mode (see references).
3. Draft output using the mode template/format.
4. Validate against baseline and mode checklist.
