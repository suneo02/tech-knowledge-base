    // When the parent is hovered, the button becomes visible
    // This requires the isHovered logic in the React component to add a class or style
    // However, with direct conditional rendering in React ( {isHovered && ...} ),
    // we can rely on the opacity and visibility transition.
    // The actual appearance animation can be triggered by changing transform on hover if needed.

    // For a "slide in from right" effect when it appears
    // We'll control opacity and visibility directly via React state for appearance/disappearance.
    // If you want a slide-in animation when it *becomes* visible:
    // You might need to add a class when isHovered becomes true, and style based on that class.
    // For simplicity, the current transition on opacity and visibility will provide a fade-in/out.
  }

  // Override for when the button should be visible (handled by React's conditional rendering)
  // This style will apply when the button is in the DOM due to `isHovered`
  // The animation comes from the transition property.
  // To make it "appear from the text", it's mostly about positioning.
  // If you want it to "grow" or "slide", more complex CSS or a library might be needed.
  // Given the request "从末尾的文字后面出现", this means it should appear to the right.

  // If you want a more explicit slide-in animation on hover:
  &:hover .@{prefix}-button {
    opacity: 1;
    visibility: visible;
    transform: translateY(-50%) translateX(15px); // MODIFIED: Moves 15px to the right to show
  }
