# 🇬🇧 English Study Plan

## 📊 Current Situation Analysis
(Refer to [My Language Profile](../../README.md#my-language-profile) for general background)
**Core Issue**: Good vocabulary/grammar, but systematic "Real English Input + Output" is lacking.
**Goal**: Comprehensive improvement, with a specific focus on **Speaking** and **Listening**.

## 1) Listening: "Comprehensible Input + Intensive Listening & Retelling"
*Replace "question brushing" with real input.*

*   **Goal**: Move from "hearing test points" to "hearing real speed & expression".
*   **Routine (20–40 mins/session)**:
    *   **Extensive Listening (10–15 mins)**: Podcasts/YouTube/TV clips. Don't pause, train to keep up with rhythm.
    *   **Intensive Listening (10 mins)**: Same 1–2 min audio, loop it:
        1. Dictation or keywords.
        2. Check against subtitles for misses.
        3. Listen again & Shadow (follow reading).
    *   **Retelling (3–5 mins)**: Close subtitles, retell in your own words (focus on complete expression, not perfection).
*   **Materials**:
    *   *Beginner*: VOA Learning English / BBC Learning English.
    *   *Advanced*: NPR, The Daily, TED.

## 2) Speaking: "Output Frequency" > "Pronunciation Class"
*Weekdays: Internalize. Weekends: Vocalize.*

*   **Weekday Strategy (Silent)**:
    *   **Internal Monologue**: Think in English. Narrate your coding logic or daily tasks silently.
    *   **Non-Verbal Recall**: When you hear a phrase, pause and mentally repeat it.
*   **Weekend Strategy (Active Output)**:
    *   **Shadowing (10-15 mins)**: Mimic native audio intonation.
    *   **Improvisation (10-15 mins)**: "Describe your work week / technical challenge". Record yourself.
    *   **Correction**: Transcribe your recording, find errors, and rewrite better versions.
*   **Alternatives to Partners**:
    *   Language Exchange (Focus on high frequency, short duration).
    *   Self-recording: Weekly monologue (2 mins), compare with previous week.

## 3) Reading: "Theme Reading + Expression Absorption"
*From "Reading for Questions" to "Reading for Logic & Expression".*

*   **Method (Lightweight SQ3R)**:
    *   **Scan** titles/subtitles (30s).
    *   **Read with Questions**: Can I retell the view? How does the author exemplify?
    *   **Summarize** (3 sentences) after reading.
*   **Materials**:
    *   *News*: BBC / The Economist (Hard but fast gain).
    *   *Science*: National Geographic / Scientific American.
    *   *Career*: Direct industry content (Best effect).

## 4) Writing: "Template + Feedback + Rewrite"
*Improvement comes from rewriting, not just writing more.*

*   **Routine (2x/Week, 30 mins)**:
    1.  Write 150–250 words (Opinion/Summary/Email).
    2.  Get Feedback (Tools/Friends/Community).
    3.  **Rewrite**: Change 5 sentences to be more natural (Focus on sentences, not just words).
*   **Types**:
    *   Emails (Request, Follow-up, Apology).
    *   Self-intro/Resume points.
    *   Article Summary + Opinion.

## 5) Vocabulary & Expressions: "Chunks + SRS"
*Don't memorize lists. Focus on Collocations & Chunks.*

*   **Focus**: `take responsibility for...`, `be skeptical about...`, `a growing body of evidence suggests...`
*   **Action**: Good expression → Record sentence/phrase → Anki (or similar).
*   **Volume**: 10 cards/day (Consistency > Intensity).

## 6) 📅 Weekly Schedule (Replicable)

**Weekdays (Work Mode: Input Focused)**
*   **Listening (Priority #1)**:
    *   *Commute/Chores*: Extensive Listening (Podcasts/Tech News) - Maximize this time.
    *   *Dedicated Session (20 mins)*: Intensive Listening (Dictation/Transcription). No speaking required.
*   **Reading/Writing (Priority #2)**:
    *   Read 1 technical article or doc section.
    *   Write a short summary (3-5 sentences) or journal entry.
*   **Speaking**: None (Silent internal monologue only).

**Weekends (Deep Output Mode)**
*   **Speaking Sprint**: 30-45 mins of dedicated Speaking (Shadowing/Improvisation).
*   **Long Reading**: Deep dive into complex texts.
*   **Review**: Go over the week's dictations and written summaries.

## 7) 🔑 Key Mindset: "Use English to Do Things"
*   Read professional/industry content in English.
*   Take notes in English.
*   Write short diary entries (5 sentences/day).
